 ### Compilation
 gcc.exe -Wall -Wextra -g3 .\cipher.c .\lw_base64.c  -o .\cipher.exe



### Self-Injection
1-Allocate memory inside the process memory(VirtualAlloc)
2-Copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space.
3-Create a thread that will run the shellcode.
4-Hold the execution until the thred completes the execution of the shellcode.
5-Close the handle to the thread.
VirtualFree()

### Process-Injection
0-Get an handle to the desire process.
1-Allocate memory inside the memory space of that process(VirtualAllocEx)
2-Copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space.
3-Create a thread that will run the shellcode.
4-Hold the execution until the thred completes the execution of the shellcode.
5-Close the handle to the thread and the handle to the process.
VirtualFreeEx()
